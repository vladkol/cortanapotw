Cortana's Pick of the Week 
===========

[Cortana's](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/cortana/meet-cortana) Pick of the Week app made for "This Week on Channel 9" (http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9). 

If you want to know how to integrate your app with Cortana, there is a great talk on that - ["Integrating Your App into the Windows Phone Speech Experience"](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-530) by  Rob Chambers, F Avery Bishop and Monica South. 

There is also a good collection of links to samples - http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/blog/Cortana-whats-new-There-are-new-code-samples 


We are using this app at "This Week on Channel 9" for making some fun around technologies. 
This app reqires some configuration. By default it starts in the configuration mode where you can specify header, title, 2 images, URL for this week's Pick of the Week **and** an actual [SSML](http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/) or text for Cortana talking through.

Then, with launching the app via Cortana (ask *"Cortana, what is you pick of the week?"*) you will get something like on a picture below and Cortana talking.

Good luck!
